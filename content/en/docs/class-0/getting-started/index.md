## Discord Server

We will use Discord to communicate between class meetings. Please use this forum to post any questions or comments.

1. Join the class Discord server using the invitation link: [https://discord.gg/NGMGbjK8w3](https://discord.gg/NGMGbjK8w3).
1. Note that we are using the same server as previous classes, so you may see some activity there from before.

## IDE Installation

Unlike other tools like Processing or TouchDesigner, openFrameworks does not come with its own development environment (IDE). You will need to install this separately.

IDEs can be large downloads and take up a lot of disk space, so its best to install these before the start of class.

### macOS

You will use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS.

1. Download Xcode directly from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
1. Wait for the download and installation to complete.
1. Open a Terminal window (You can find the Terminal in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`).
1. Install the command line tools by typing in the command (then hit `ENTER`!)

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Windows

You will use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) on Windows.

1. Download Visual Studio Community 2022 from the [official site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
1. Open the Visual Studio Installer and select the `Desktop environment with C++` workload.
1. Press `Install` or `Modify` in the bottom right corner of the window.
1. Wait for the download and installation to complete.
