OpenCV was originally released in 2000 and has gone through many updates and revisions since then. The library is cross-platform and available for all major platforms. It includes interfaces in C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript. OpenCV includes hundreds of algorithms, for performing a variety of tasks like image conversion, object tracking, feature recognition, camera calibration, etc. OpenCV uses its own image type, called cv::Mat.</description></item><item><title>Object Tracking</title><link>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-4/object-tracking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 20:48:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-4/object-tracking/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s build an app together that tracks an object in the frame over time.
We are going to track a red playing card and can assume that the card will be the &amp;ldquo;most red&amp;rdquo; element in the frame.
Contour Finding # In order to do this, we will use a Contour Finding algorithm.
Contour finding consists of identifying regions of images matching a particular pattern. These patterns can be defined by color, size, shape, speed, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
