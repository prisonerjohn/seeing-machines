Video is two-dimensional, it has a width and a height.
Depth sensors are special types of cameras that add a third dimension to the mix; they can see width, height, and depth. Depth in this context means the distance away from the camera where a captured pixel is situated.
It is important to note the difference between full 3D and depth.</description></item></channel></rss>
