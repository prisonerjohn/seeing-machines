This is done by reading and interpreting digital images and video.
Operations # What are some common computer vision operations?
Image filtering Convert from one color space to another (e.g. RGB to grayscale). Adjust brightness and contrast. Blur or sharpen the image. Edge detection. Understanding Edge Detection (Sobel Operator) Background subtraction Detect moving objects by comparing them to a reference frame.</description></item><item><title>Intro to OpenCV</title><link>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-3/intro-to-opencv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 16:37:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-3/intro-to-opencv/</guid><description>OpenCV is an open-source library for performing computer vision operations.
OpenCV was originally released in 2000 and has gone through many updates and revisions since then. The library is cross-platform and available for all major platforms. It includes interfaces in C++, Java, and Python. OpenCV includes hundreds of algorithms, for performing a variety of tasks like image conversion, object tracking, feature recognition, camera calibration, etc. OpenCV uses its own image type, called cv::Mat.</description></item></channel></rss>
