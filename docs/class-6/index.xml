Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got data that also has depth, we can move into the third dimension to represent it. This means using (x, y, z) for position, and [width, height, depth] for size.
By default, the openFrameworks canvas is set to 2D. The origin (0, 0) is in the top-left, and values increase as we move right and down.</description></item><item><title>Networking</title><link>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-6/networking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 19:17:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-6/networking/</guid><description>openFrameworks applications often need to communicate information with other programs. These can be on the same machine or on a different one, they can be written in OF or using a different framework or language. These programs need to use a common protocol for communicating, to ensure that the messages reach their destination, and that the receiver knows how to decode them.
Using the network is a good choice for sending and receiving information, as most machines and frameworks already have the infrastructure to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
