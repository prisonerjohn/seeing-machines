We cannot just throw everything inside ofApp as it quickly becomes unwieldy and hard to navigate.
We can use classes to separate our app functionality into different modules. A class is a structure that contains variables and functions as members.
A class is the definition of this structure. An object is an instance of the class.</description></item><item><title>Mapping</title><link>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-10/mapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 14:33:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-10/mapping/</guid><description>OpenCV includes many functions for calibrating and mapping points and images between different spaces.
Homography # A homography is a transformation that reorients one image to match or fit inside another:
The two images are usually two points of view of the same subject. Common features are found in both images and paired to make a data set. Feature Matching + Homography to find Objects The data set is then used with the cv::findHomography function, which returns a matrix that allows us to warp one image into the other.</description></item></channel></rss>
