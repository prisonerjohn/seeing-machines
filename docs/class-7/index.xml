These can be on the same machine or on a different one, they can be written in OF or using a different framework or language. These programs need to use a common protocol for communicating, to ensure that the messages reach their destination, and that the receiver knows how to decode them.
Using the network is a good choice for sending and receiving information, as most machines and frameworks already have the infrastructure to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
