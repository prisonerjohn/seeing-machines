These can be on the same machine or on a different one, they can be written in OF or using a different framework or language. These programs need to use a common protocol for communicating, to ensure that the messages reach their destination, and that the receiver knows how to decode them.
Using the network is a good choice for sending and receiving information, as most machines and frameworks already have the infrastructure to do so.</description></item><item><title>Texture Sharing</title><link>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-7/texture-sharing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 15:46:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://seeingmachines.betamovement.net/docs/class-7/texture-sharing/</guid><description>It is sometimes necessary to share more than just state updates or short messages between applications. We may need to share an entire image over for various reasons:
Continue image processing in another app. Use OF image as a texture for a material in a 3D rendering application. Projection map the OF image using mapping software. Use OF as an input for VJ software. Etc. Texture sharing is often required for building interactive installations, and there are a few options for doing so.</description></item></channel></rss>
