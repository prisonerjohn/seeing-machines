Main Primitives # int # 32 bits of data (usually but not always) represents a whole number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 int videoWidth = 1920; int videoHeight = 1080; int numVideoPixels = videoWidth * videoHeight; integers do not support decimal points ✌️ Integer division / and modulo % operators
Operations on integers return integers. This is particularly important to remember with division /.</description></item></channel></rss>
